Mileage Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict vehicle mileage (fuel efficiency) using machine learning techniques. It utilizes various features of vehicles to train models that can accurately predict their fuel consumption.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Usage
After installation, you can train machine learning models to predict mileage. Use train.py with the appropriate arguments to train a model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path data/train.csv --model_type RandomForestRegressor


Models
Several machine learning models are implemented for mileage prediction, including Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Support Vector Regression.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a separate test dataset.
