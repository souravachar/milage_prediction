Mileage Prediction


Overview
This project focuses on predicting the mileage (fuel efficiency) of vehicles using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of vehicles, such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and others, the models trained in this project can provide accurate predictions of their fuel consumption.

Installation
To use this project locally, follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installation, you can train machine learning models to predict vehicle mileage. Here's an example command to train a Random Forest Regression model:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path data/train.csv --model_type RandomForestRegressor
You can then use the trained model to make predictions on new data.



Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from XYZ Dataset Repository. It contains information about various vehicles, including features such as engine size, horsepower, weight, mileage, and others. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.



Models
In this project, we have implemented several machine learning models for mileage prediction, including Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Support Vector Regression. These models are trained using the features from the dataset to predict the mileage of vehicles.



Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The models are tested on a separate test dataset to assess their accuracy and generalization ability.
